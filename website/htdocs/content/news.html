<h3>JavaGit Releases Version 0.1.0 Alpha</h3>
<h4>August 4, 2008</h4>
<p>
  The JavaGit team is pleased to announce the release of JavaGit version 0.1.0
  alpha, an API providing access to git repositories from Java programs.  The 
  goal of JavaGit is to bring the power of git to the Java developer as an API 
  that is intuitive for developers new to git and developers who are veteran 
  git users.
</p>
<p>
  JavaGit is engineered to provide the developer with access to the raw git
  commands through a command API as well as an object API designed to represent
  the .git repository, the working tree and other, familiar git concepts.
  JavaGit uses the git binaries installed on the host machine to proide git
  functionality and has been designed to easily accommodate additional methods
  of access to git repositories.
</p>
<p>
  JavaGit is released as open source software under the GNU LGPL license.
