<h2>JavaGit FAQ</h2>

<ol>
<li> 
Why would I want to use JavaGit? <br><br>

So that your java application can access, create and modify git repositories 
with as little work as possible.  Without JavaGit, you will need to write and
manage forking code yourself, flex your JNI muscle or reimplement git in Java
yourself.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
Who are the intended users of JavaGit? <br><br>

Java developers who want to access, create or modify git repositories from 
their own applications. <br><br>
</li>
<li>
Do I still need git installed? <br><br>

Yes.  JavaGit currently uses the command-line git client to interface with 
git repositories.  There are currently no plans for a pure java git 
implementation, but we are open to doing such an implementation in the future.
If this is super important to you, let us know. <br><br>
</li>
<li>
Where can I get the source?<br><br>

The code is in a publicly accessible SVN repository at: <br><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; $ svn checkout https://subversive.cims.nyu.edu/osp/ <br><br>
</li>
<li>
Isn't using svn to host a git oriented program a bit hypocritical? <br><br>

Yes, it is.  We chose subversion for the time being because some of the tools 
we are using for JavaGit development (Eclipse, Crucible, Fisheye) do not yet 
interface with git repsitories.  Our sister project, Gitclipse, is working to 
fill the Eclipse-Git void.<br><br>

Once these tools work sufficiently well with git, we will move over to using 
git for our repository. <br><br>
</li>
<li>
Can I use git to access the source code in the mean time? <br><br>

Yes, you can!  Check out the git-svn command; it works very well. <br><br>
</li>
<li>
Is this under active development? <br><br>

Extremely. We have commits on a daily basis, just check the SVN log: <br><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; $ svn log https://subversive.cims.nyu.edu/osp/javagit <br><br>
</li>
<li>
When will an alpha/beta/stable release be available? <br><br>

We are expecting an alpha release in the next few weeks.  We hope to have a 
beta release by the end of the summer and a stable release soon thereafter.
<br><br>

<li>
Are there Milestones? <br><br>

<li>
Why not implement git using java (this way you don't need git installed)? 
<br><br>

We'd LOVE to, but unfortunately we don't have the time. We are gladly accepting patches. ;-) <br><br>
</li>
<li>
How is JavaGit different from Jgit/Egit? <br><br>

Who/What? <br><br>

No. But seriously now.  JavaGit was conceived of as a complementary project to
the <a href="http://gitclipse.sourceforge.net">GitClipse</a> projct, an Eclipse
plugin to provide git support.  It was a logical choice for us to split the 
project into the user oriented project, Gitclipse, and the developer oriented
project, JavaGit.  Since the projects are separate, the JavaGit project is free
to concentrate on providing a top-notch library/API for use in other 
applications.  <br><br>

Jgit/Egit, on the other hand, appear to be tightly integrated with Jgit
primarily supporting Egit. <br><br>

Another difference between JavaGit and Jgit/Egit is that the JavaGit team 
wanted to quickly implement access to git repositories.  This goal lead us to
start by forking to git itself to provide git functionality.  Knowing that this
may be a short-term solution, we built JavaGit so that we can easily replace
the command line interface (CLI) functionality with JNI, pure Java, or some 
other implementation in the future.  Jgit/Egit only provides a pure Java 
implementation. <br><br>

How can I contribute? <br><br>

Join the conversation on the developer mailing list.  There are lots of things
to do. <br><br>
