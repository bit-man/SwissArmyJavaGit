<!--
  This build script generates a zip of the source.

  Q: Why use this script instead of 'mvn source:jar'?
  A: This script generates a zip file with the entire javagit source tree
     including the main source, the test source and the maven pom file.  The
     'mvn source:jar' command generates a jar file containing only the main
     source.  For distribution of the project source, it is preferable to
     provide an easy means of building the source for those who download it.
