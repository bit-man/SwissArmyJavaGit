title: Welcome to the Swiss Army JavaGit project.
---

JavaGit is a Java API that provides access to git repositories. Our goal is to
provide a library with an easy-to-use API that is intuitive for developers new
to git and developers who are veteran git users.

If you are in need of a Java library to help access git repositories, please
take a look at our documentation and [FAQ](faq.html). We appreicate feedback;
if you have something to ask, have a feature that is critical to your
application, or want to help out, please post a request
to the [bug tracker](https://github.com/bit-man/SwissArmyJavaGit/issues).

### Get the Code

  * `git clone https://github.com/bit-man/SwissArmyJavaGit.git`
  * Get it from [Maven Central Repository](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cjavagit)

### Requirements

We have tested JavaGit on the following environments:

  * Windows XP/Vista with git through msysgit or Cygwin
  * OS X with git version 1.5.5+
  * Linux with git version 1.5.5+

Also earlier version can be supported, but they are on a best effort basis. Look at 
JavaGit news, [we are looking for help](news.html) on testing for different environments
