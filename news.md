### JavaGit Releases Version 0.1.0 Alpha

#### August 4, 2008

The JavaGit team is pleased to announce the release of JavaGit version 0.1.0
alpha, a Java API to [Git](http://git.or.cz) (the popular distributed version
control system). The JavaGit API is both friendly to users just getting the
hang of Git and familiar to experts well versed in Git's porcelain and
plumbing.

Use JavaGit's command API for access to raw git commands or the object API for
type-safe and Java-friendly access to the the .git folder, the working tree,
and other familiar git concepts. Visit the [JavaGit Cookbook](cookbook.html) to
get started.

JavaGit is released as open source software under the GNU LGPL license.
