Version 0.1.0

  This is the initial release of JavaGit.  Since there have been no public
  releases prior to this release, the entire API has changed from nothing
  into itself.  The initial functionality that is available is:

    1) An object API representing the git repository, working tree and other
       git concepts:

      - DotGit (represents the repository directory, .git)
      - WorkingTree (represents the working tree)
      - Ref (represents git refs, a.k.a. treeish arguments)
      - GitFile (represents a file in the git working tree)
      - GitDirectory (represents a directory in the git working tree)

    2) Commands implemented and available:

      - GitAdd
      - GitBranch
      - GitCheckout
      - GitCommit
      - GitLog
      - GitMv
      - GitReset
      - GitRm
      - GitStatus

    3) In this initial implementation, JavaGit uses the command line git client
       to provide git functionality.  Configuration may be needed to indicate
       where the git binaries are located.  The "JavaGitConfiguration" class 
       provides the ability to set the location of the git binaries if they are
       not on the system's PATH.
