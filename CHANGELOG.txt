                             JavaGit Change Log

Version 0.1.0

  This is the initial release of JavaGit.  Since there have been no public
  releases prior to this release, the entire API has changed from nothing
  into itself.  The initial functionality that is available is:

    An object API representing the git repository, working tree and other
    git concepts:

      - DotGit (represents the repository directory, .git)
      - WorkingTree (represents the working tree)
      - Ref (represents git refs, a.k.a. treeish arguments)
      - GitFile (represents a file in the git working tree)
      - GitDirectory (represents a directory in the git working tree)

    Commands implemented and available:

      - GitAdd
      - GitBranch
      - GitCheckout
      - GitCommit
      - GitLog
      - GitMv
      - GitReset
      - GitRm
      - GitStatus

    In this initial implementation, JavaGit uses the command line git client
    to provide git functionality.  Configuration may be needed to indicate
    where the git binaries are located.  The "JavaGitConfiguration" class 
    provides the ability to set the location of the git binaries if they are
    not on the system's PATH.
